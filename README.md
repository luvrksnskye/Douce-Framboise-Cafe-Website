# Douce Framboise Cafe! 🍓

Welcome to the most special corner of the internet - a website made with love for my amazing friend! ✨

## 💖 About This Project

I decided to create this website as a gift for my friend Morita. I hope she enjoys it; I'm really happy to be doing all of this for her. And about the source code... I learned how to code HTML and CSS by looking at other people's code and playing around with it offline, you're welcome to do that with mine! i also learned by going to sites like w3schools, using HTML templates, and the likes.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This project is built with:
- HTML/CSS for all the pretty parts
- JavaScript for the interactive elements
- Lots of love and inside jokes

## 💕 Special Thanks

To my friend - for being the incredible human that you are. You deserve a whole internet of websites, but I hope this one makes you smile!
